List-Unique-DeterministicOrder

This module provides a structure to store a set
of keys and be able to access (mostly delete)
them by either key name or index.

The algorithm used inserts keys at the end, but
swaps keys around on deletion.  Hence it is
deterministic and repeatable, but only if the
sequence of insertion and deletions is replicated
exactly.  

The algorithm used is from
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5682218/data-structure-insert-remove-contains-get-random-element-all-at-o1/5684892#5684892

The system does not store any contents with the keys,
so it is more of a "set" structure, but one that
does not do intersections, unions and the like.

So why would one use this in the first place?
The motivating use case was to track keys
under a random selection procedure 
where keys are extracted from a pool of keys,
and sometimes inserted.  e.g. the process might
select and remove the 10th key, then the 257th,
then insert a new key, followed by more selections
and removals.  The randomisations needed to 
produce the same results same for the same given
PRNG sequence for reproducibility purposes.
Using a hash to store the data provides rapid access,
but getting the nth key requires the key list be generated,
and Perl's hashes do not provide their keys in a deterministic
order across all versions and platforms.  
Binary searches over sorted lists proved very
effective for a while, but bottlenecks started
to manifest when the data sets became
much larger and the number of lists
became both abundant and lengthy.
Since the order itself does not matter,
only the ability to replicate it, this module was written.
